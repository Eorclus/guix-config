This directory was made specifically for "GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH" environment
variable.  It contains a symlink 'al/guix/packages' which points to my
package directory.  Thus it contains my packages (and _only_ the
packages) placed in a proper hierarchy.

I didn't set "GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH" to a directory with all my guile
modules (which includes the (al guix â€¦) stuff) as Guix will traverse all
those modules and all variables inside to find the packages, which is
long and may find unwanted things.
